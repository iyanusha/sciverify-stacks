# SciVerify: Immutable Scientific Review Framework

A decentralized platform for transparent scientific peer reviews built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's security and zero-knowledge proofs to maintain review integrity while eliminating bias.

## 🔍 Overview

SciVerify revolutionizes the scientific peer review process by creating an immutable, transparent, and fair system for academic publication reviews. By leveraging blockchain technology, we address key issues in traditional peer review:

- **Reviewer Bias**: Zero-knowledge proof system enables blind reviews while verifying reviewer credentials
- **Review Transparency**: All reviews are published post-decision, creating accountability
- **Reputation Systems**: Tokenized reputation for both authors and reviewers based on contribution quality
- **Immutable Records**: Publication and review history permanently recorded on the Stacks blockchain
- **Incentive Alignment**: Token rewards for quality reviews and contributions

## ⚙️ Core Features

- **Blind Review Protocol**: ZK-proof system that validates reviewer credentials without revealing identity
- **Tokenized Reputation**: Reputation tokens that evolve based on community validation
- **Bitcoin-Anchored Publication Records**: Leveraging Stacks' connection to Bitcoin for immutable research history
- **Smart Contract Review Management**: Automated workflow for submission, review assignment, and publication
- **Decentralized Review Discovery**: Matching papers with appropriate reviewers through credential verification
- **Community Governance**: Token-weighted voting on protocol changes and academic standards

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `review-protocol.clar`: Core review workflow and process management
- `reputation-token.clar`: SFT implementation for reputation tracking
- `publication-registry.clar`: Immutable registry of publications and reviews
- `credential-verification.clar`: Zero-knowledge credential verification
- `governance.clar`: Community governance and protocol updates

### Frontend Components
- Author dashboard for submission and tracking
- Reviewer interface with blind review capabilities
- Publication explorer with review transparency
- Reputation management system
- Community governance portal

## 📊 Stacks Integration Points
